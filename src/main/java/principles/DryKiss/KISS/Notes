The KISS principle is descriptive to "keep the code simple and clear, making it easy to understand".
After all, programming languages are for humans to understand — computers can only understand 0 and 1 — so
keep coding simple and straightforward. Keep your methods small. Each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.

Each method should only solve one small problem, not many use cases. If you have a lot of conditions in the method,
break these out into smaller methods. It will not only be easier to read and maintain,
but it can help find bugs a lot faster.

Violations of KISS

We have all likely experienced the situation where we get work to do in a project and found some messy code written.
That leads us to ask why they have written these unnecessary lines.
Just have a look at below two code snippets shown below. Both methods are doing the same thing.
Now you have to decide which one to use:

public String weekday1(int day) {
    switch (day) {

        case 1:

            return "Monday";

        case 2:

            return "Tuesday";

        case 3:

            return "Wednesday";

        case 4:

            return "Thursday";

        case 5:

            return "Friday";

        case 6:

            return "Saturday";

        case 7:

            return "Sunday";

        default:

            throw new InvalidOperationException("day must be in range 1 to 7");

    }

}

public String weekday2(int day) {

    if ((day < 1) || (day > 7)) throw new InvalidOperationException("day must be in range 1 to 7");

    string[] days = {

        "Monday",

        "Tuesday",

        "Wednesday",

        "Thursday",

        "Friday",

        "Saturday",

        "Sunday"

    };

    return days[day - 1];

}
